‚òê Complete class integration @started(02-07-20 23:07)
    06/07/2020 (Supplemental):
        We have just been optmising the project from the tutorial template.
        Up until the optimisation of the template for this project, I have mainly been doing this on my own.
        Mohammed Maqbol has joined me in the effort to organise classes accordingly since the tutorial provided a messy way of organising all code. Good for beginners but not for people who are planning to do a game with this template.
        It appears that during optimisation, we need to create a group class for the enemies.
        The enemies have different speeds and in the future will probably have different abilities as well, or perhaps different cannons or weapons.
        We need to be able to separate the classes between each type of enemy so that we can make these changes without interfering with other enemies.
        At least, that is the future of this game after class optimisation.
        After we finish with the classes, it will be pushed to our repository and made publically avialable for anyone that wants to use it.
        Additionally, I made some minor differences to the tutorial version, so the code may not be exactly the same despite the class implementations.

        This project is new and followed the directions of Luis Zuno in his YouTube videos.
        The goal of this project will be to implement classes for making this type of game.
        Developers for this task will be completed by: Luke Wolf (LukeWolfGames) and Mohommad Maqbol (Enjoy2Live).
